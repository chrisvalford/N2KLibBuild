 * \brief NMEA2000 standard type definitions.
 * 
 *
 * This file contains (and must only contain) type definitions of data types
 * defined in the NMEA2000 standard.  These all have names of the form "DDnnn".
 * The language of the definitions should follow exactly that of the standard
 * document from which the information is drawn.  No abbreviated names. No
 * mangled capitalisation.

 * The entries here are mostly enums describing bit field types. Where an enum
 * member has multiple meanings, each meaning is aliased (see tN2kDD0002 for an
 * example).

 * This file is included by N2kTypes.h where the standard code names are aliased
 * into corresponding long names (once again, exactly as described by NMEA).
